# Cross-Platform Traceroute Tool Requirements
# 
# This project uses only Python standard library modules:
# - argparse (command line parsing)
# - subprocess (running system commands)
# - json (output formatting)
# - os (file operations)
# - statistics (statistical calculations)
# - re (regular expressions)
# - time (delays between runs)
# - platform (platform detection)
# - shutil (command detection)
#
# No external dependencies required!
# Python 3.6+ recommended for best compatibility
